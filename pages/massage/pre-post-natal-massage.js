Prenatal massage offers a gentle and holistic approach to alleviate these discomforts, promoting relaxation and increasing circulation. Beyond the physical relief, it also provides emotional support, creating a nurturing environment for both mother and baby. The gentle strokes and specialized techniques used not only soothe tense muscles but also reduce stress and anxiety, ensuring that the mother feels rejuvenated and better equipped to handle the demands of pregnancy.",

  differenceDetails:
    "Infant massage is a beautiful way to strengthen the bond between a parent and their newborn. It encompasses gentle, rhythmic strokes designed to soothe and comfort the baby, aiding in relaxation and promoting better sleep. But the benefits of infant massage extend beyond just relaxation. Regular sessions can aid in digestion, help relieve colic, and even enhance the baby's developmental milestones. The tactile stimulation provided through infant massage plays a crucial role in the baby's physical and emotional development. Moreover, the dedicated one-on-one time during massage sessions fosters a deep sense of connection and trust, aiding in the formation of secure attachments which are vital for the child's long-term well-being and emotional health.",
