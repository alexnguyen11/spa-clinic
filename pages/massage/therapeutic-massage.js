    "Therapeutic massage is a general term that describes any type of massage modality that helps relieve pain, reduce stress, or work on a specific problem area. It involves manipulating the body's soft tissues, including muscles, connective tissue, tendons, and ligaments. While it shares some techniques with other forms of massage, such as Swedish or deep tissue, therapeutic massage is often more problem-specific. It's particularly beneficial for those with chronic pain or tension, injuries, or specific health conditions. The primary goal of therapeutic massage is to target the root of one's pain or tension and provide relief. Regular sessions can also improve circulation, enhance physical health, and increase overall well-being.",
