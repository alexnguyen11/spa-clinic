    "An athlete is a person who participates in sports either as an amateur or a professional. Often the activity involves repetitive use of one group of muscles more than others, which may result in hypertrophy, changes in strength patterns or changes in connective tissue formation and compensation patterns in the rest of the body. Regular massage allows the body to function with less restriction and accelerates recovery time.",

The increased blood flow to the muscle helps keep the tissue healthy, which in turn would reduce the occurrence of injuries. The purpose of these protocols would be to keep the athlete in the best physical condition possible between games or seasons. This service could also be provided on-site if that is deemed most efficient use of the athlete’s time.",
